# MatematPad
Very basic Virtual Keyboard with mathematic characters. Just that.

### Why?
It's a very simple and rough project that i made on my free time, tired of do a lot of steps to put symbols like α,δ or Δ when doing university homework. It keeps itself on top of sreen at every moment, saving you for lots of copy-paste or digging into windows OSK.

Mostly composed of a Tkinter GUI with some Python plugins.

Currently only works in Windows because it relies on PyGetWindow to trick Windows keyboard focus behaviour.
However i plan to make it work in Linux (which should be simpler) in the future.

### Current features
- Write scientific characters in the current selected textbox by pressing the button (Just like any other keyboard, duh)
- Four themes available (Breeze, Equilux, Arc , WinUI)
- Always on top
- Option to hide window decoration

### To do
- Linux support
- Switch between different modes (keyboard, copy to clipboard, keyboard+copy to clipboard)
- Option to hide menu bar
- Multiple language support (Currently Spanish only)
